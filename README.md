3D Printer Files for 3D Printer Filament Respooler

Not all filament comes on the same size spools, so sometimes it becomes necessary to respool to a spool that fits your printer. These are the .stl files for the parts needed to create a powered respooler for 3D printer filament. Our design used a stepper motor to turn the drive gear, but any motor with a 5mm D-shaped shaft sould work as long as you have an appropriate motor controller.
